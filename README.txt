Project Name: Livestock Tracker
Name: Clarissa Edwards
Due Date: 12/11/2025

Description: 
	This project is a database that will track all the animals on the farm. However, it is only chickens, cows, goats and horses. All information is saved to textfiles and read in and manipulated by the program.

NOTE: The makefile has an added line to convert all textfiles to Linux friendly files. So if anything comes up about converting files, that is what that is. Windows and Linux don't like to talk the same language and I Googled how to convert them in a makefile so that the user would not have too.
